# DOI wanted - random selection of 1000 open citations from Crossref 
(cited by journal articles published 2015-2017)

Script accompanying poster activity at [Workshop on Open Citations](https://workshop-oc.github.io/) (Sept 3-5 2018, Bologna, Italy)

## BACKGROUND
Open citations are an important part of open scholarly infrastructure. Their development also shows both the power and limitations of 
established parties, restricting their potential use for the wider scholarly community. 

### QUALITY OF CITATION DATA
More and more publishers are making references openly available through Crossref, but their quality is often still suboptimal, 
with many references lacking important information including DOIs (Fig 1a). This limits their use in open citation indexes, 
like OpenCitations’ [COCI](http://opencitations.net/index/coci) index.

### COMMUNITY ENRICHMENT – an experiment
To explore the power of community enrichment of citations, we took a random sample of open citations from Crossref (Fig 1b), 
identified citations to journal articles missing DOIs and presented a subset for enrichment by conference participants.

### POSSIBILITIES AND PITFALLS
Community enrichment of citation data would enable the scholarly community as a whole to not only to make optimal use of open citations, 
but also contribute to their value, without enclosing the enriched data. 

Questions around enrichment of open citation data include: whether responsibility for providing good citation data should be extended 
beyond publishers, what legitimate sources to get additional citation data information from (eg [Wikidata](https://tools.wmflabs.org/sourcemd/), 
how alternative routes to enrichment would scale, and how provenance of enrichments should be dealt with.
